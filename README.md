A short CHIP-8 game made with the Octo language about a female hero slashing her way through to the princess. Made part of OctoJam 7!

Much thanks to the [The Internet Janitor](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) for the help on starting out and for making a fantastic
language and platform to work with CHIP-8 programs! :)
